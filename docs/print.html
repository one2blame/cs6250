<ul>
<li>Includes multiple protocols:
<ul>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>SMTP</li>
<li>FTP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
</ul>

packets of information are referred to as messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentation Layer</strong></p>
<ul>

from the layer below and delivers it to the Application layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Layer responsible for managing different transport streams that belong to
session between end-user applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transport Layer</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Layer</strong></p>
<ul>

layer implements the <strong>IP</strong> protocol, defining the structure of datagrams,
how datagram information is processed, and routing protocols used to determine
routes between hosts.</li>
<li>Packets of information at this layer are referred to as datagrams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Link Layer</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This layer facilitates the interaction with the actual hardware and is
responsible for transferring bits of a frame between two nodes connected
through a physical link.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>De-encapsulation</strong></p>

<li>Examine all layers from top to bottom and perform:
<ul>
<li>Connect new nodes at each layer by choosing substrates (lower layer node)
based on the generality probabilities of the layer below and choosing products
(higher layer) based on the generality probability of the current layer</li>
<li>Update the value of each node at this layer</li>
<li>Examine all nodes in order of decreasing value in the layer and remove nodes
that should die</li>

<ul>
<li>A device with multiple inputs/outputs that transfers frames from an input to
one or multiple outputs. It learns from each frame it receives by populating a
forwarding table so that it forwards frames on specific ports instead of
broadcasting everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-distributed-algorithm" id="what-is-a-distributed-algorithm">What is a distributed algorithm?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Direct nodes send information to one another, and then they resend their
results back after performing their own calculations, so the calculations are
not happening in a centralized manner.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#explain-the-spanning-tree-algorithm" id="explain-the-spanning-tree-algorithm">Explain the Spanning Tree Algorithm</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Runs in rounds. Each node first thinks it is the root. Each node sends a
configuration message with the sending node’s ID, root as perceived by this
node, and number of hops from this node to its root. When a node receives a
message, it updates its root if it finds a lower ID root, better path to the
root, or equal path to the root if the sender of the message has a lower ID.</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-2" id="lesson-2">Lesson 2</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 1 Study Guide for Lesson
2:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does the Transport Layer provide?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Transport Layer provides an end-to-end connection between two applications
that are running on different hosts, regardless if the hosts are in the same
network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a packet for the Transport Layer called?</p>
<ul>
<li>Packets at the Transport Layer are called segments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the two main protocols within the Transport Layer?</p>
<ul>
<li>The two main protocols within the Transport Layer are:
<ul>
<li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</li>
<li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is multiplexing, and why is it necessary?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Transport Layer utilizes ports to implement <strong>multiplexing</strong>, allowing
hosts to utilize the network for multiple applications. Multiplexing allows
multiple streams of information to exist on the same network, and the division
of the streams to different applications at the endpoint is achieved using
ports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the two types of multiplexing/demultiplexing</p>
<ul>
<li>The two types of multiplexing / demultiplexing are <strong>connectionless</strong> and
<strong>connection-oriented</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>connectionless</strong> multiplexing / demultiplexing uses UDP and only requires
the destination IP address and destination port.</li>
<li><strong>connection-oriented</strong> multiplexing / demultiplexing uses TCP and requires
the source IP address, source port, destination IP address and destination
port.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the differences between UDP and TCP?</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP provides end-to-end communication and reliability.</li>
<li>UDP offers no congestion control or similar mechanisms and no connection
management overhead. The Application Layer must implement these features, if
necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When would an application layer protocol choose UDP over TCP?</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP is useful for real-time applications that are sensitive to delays. The
following are some applications / protocols that utilize UDP:
<ul>
<li>Remote file servers</li>
<li>Streaming multimedia</li>
<li>Internet telephony / VOIP</li>
<li>Network management</li>
<li>Routing protocols (e.g. RIP)</li>
<li>Name translation (i.e. DNS)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the TCP Three-way Handshake</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The TCP three-way handshake is the TCP protocol's method of initiating a
connection with a host. TCP segments contain flags that are used to send TCP
specific messages related to the protocol. For the three-way handshake, the
flags <code>SYN</code> and <code>ACK</code> are used. The host initiating the connection begins by
sending the remote host a <code>SYN</code> TCP message. The remote host responds with a
<code>SYN, ACK</code> TCP message. Finally, the initiating host responds with an <code>ACK</code>
TCP message, establishing the session - from there the Application Layer takes
over to utilize the session for TCP-centric applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial <code>SYN</code> TCP message and the <code>SYN, ACK</code> message from the server both
contain a random sequence number. Each number will be incremented by <code>1</code> each
time the two hosts communicate using TCP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the TCP connection tear down</p>
<ul>
<li>When the client is ready to close the connection, it sends a <code>FIN</code> TCP segment
to the server. The server responds with an <code>ACK</code> TCP segment. When the server
has completed its destruction of the TCP connection, it sends a <code>FIN</code> TCP
segment to the client, and the client responds with <code>ACK</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is Automatic Repeat Request or ARQ?</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP segments contain a segment number, allowing both hosts to know which
segments were sent or received. Using TCP, hosts can acknowledge that they
receive specific segments, allowing sending hosts to know if the receiver
received all of the segments or if the receiver missed specific segments. If a
specific segment is not acknowledged by the receiver, the sender can assume the
segment didn't reach the receiver - after a timeout it will resend the segment.
This is <strong>ARQ</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is Stop and Wait ARQ?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what I described in the previous paragraph - sending and receiving
with a timeout for acknowledged segments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is Go-back-N?</p>
<ul>
<li>A modification of <strong>Stop and Wait ARQ</strong> that is more performant. Essentially,
the receiver only acknowledges the most recently received, in order segment.
So if the sender sends 10 segments, and the receiver acknowledges segment 7,
then the receiver knows that maybe 8, 9, or 10 were either received out of order
or lost entirely. Thus, the sender will resend the entire window of 1-10
segments. The receiver will disregard 1-7 because it already has them, but will
hopefully acknowledge segment 10, meaning it got the entire window of segments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is selective ACKing?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is another mutation of the above protocols, however, the receiver can
now receive segments out of order. The sender can now know that some segments
were dropped or corrupted on their trip to the receiver. Once the entire window
is received by the receiver, it will place the segments back into the correct
order and proceed to the Application Layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is fast retransmit?</p>
<ul>
<li>This occurs when the receiver is encountering duplicate acknowledgements for
segments that have already been acknowledged by the receiver. The sender will
resend the segment experiencing duplicate acknowledgements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is transmission control and why do we need to control it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Transmission control is used to control how much data is sent over a link by
applications in used by each host on the network. Transmission control
implements fairness on the network and congestion control for Layer 3 devices
that provide connectivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is flow control and why do we need to control it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow control controls the transmission rate to protect a receiving host's
network buffer from overflowing with information. It's possible that a receiving
host is involved with multiple processes and does not read data from its network
buffer instantly. This could cause an accumulation of data that overflows its
buffer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is congestion control?</p>
<ul>
<li>While Flow control is concerned about one specific host, Congestion Control
is concerned with protecting the entire network from congestion. Given multiple
devices using the same link, Congestion Control aims to avoid the link reaching
max capacity, thus causing dropped packets and retransmissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the goals of the congestion control?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goals of congestion control are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Efficiency - high throughput and network utilization.</li>
<li>Fairness - every host should get a fair share of the network bandwidth.</li>
<li>Low delay</li>
<li>Fast convergence - network flow should be able to quickly converge to fair
allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is network-assisted congestion control?</p>
<ul>
<li>Network-assisted congestion control involves Layer 3 devices providing
feedback to hosts on the congestion of the network. This is usually implemented
by sending diagnostic ICMP messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is end-to-end congestion control?</p>
<ul>
<li>The network does not provide any feedback to hosts about the congestion of the
network to end points. Hosts must infer network behavior and adapt their
transmission rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a host infer congestion?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two methods, both implemented via TCP:
<ul>
<li>Round trip delay - time based inference of network congestion. Difficult to
implement because round trip time varies wildly.</li>
<li>Packet loss - the TCP messages that have to be re-sent, the more we can
infer that network congestion exists. This was the first method of network
congestion implemented in TCP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a TCP sender limit the sending rate?</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP uses a congestion window, similar to the receive window for flow control
by receiving hosts. TCP probes and adapts the congestion window, increasing
to try and achieve the highest through, and decreasing when enough segments are
dropped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) in the context of TCP</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP uses addition to increase the number of packets sent in the congestion
window when the network is not experiencing congestion. Once congestion is
detected, the window is decreased by some multiplicative value, generating a
sawtooth pattern of traffic over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a slow start in TCP?</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using addition to establish the initial size of the congestion
window, TCP will exponentially increase the congestion window until congestion
is experienced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is TCP fair in the case two where connections have the same RTT? Explain</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes as both will increase and decrease window sizes as needed to balance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is TCP fair in the case where two connections have different RTTs? Explain</p>
<ul>
<li>No, a shorter RTT would increase the window faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain how TCP CUBIC works</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP CUBIC uses a cubic function for the calculation of its congestion window.
When TCP CUBIC detects congestions, it exercises a multiplicative decrease on
its congestion window. Afterwards, it greatly increases its congestion window
and plateaus until no congestion is detected. It then increases the congestion
window again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain TCP throughput calculation</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth (BW) is bound by ((Data and Time per Cycle Calculation) / (Round Trip Time (RTT))) * 1 / sqrt(Probability of Packet Loss)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-3" id="lesson-3">Lesson 3</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 1 Study Guide for Lesson
3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between the forwarding and routing?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forwarding</strong> - refers to transferring a packet from an incoming link to an
outgoing link within a single router.</li>
<li><strong>Routing</strong> - refers to how routers work together using routing protocols to
determine the good paths (or good routes as we call them) over which the packets
travel from the source to the destination node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main idea behind a link state routing algorithm?</p>
<ul>
<li>In a link state routing algorithm / protocol, link costs and the network
topology are known to all nodes.</li>
<li>Based upon Djikstra's algorithm.</li>
<li>Start with N’ just containing the source node. Initialize all paths to
infinity except directly attached nodes. Perform iterations and update whenever
we find lower costs until every node is examined and added to N’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an example of a link state routing algorithm?</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk through an example of the link state routing algorithm</p>
<ul>
<li>At each iteration, look among nodes not yet in N’, select the node with least
cost from the previous iteration. Update distance for all immediate neighbors of
this node using the lowest cost paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the computational complexity of the link state routing algorithm?</p>
<ul>
<li>O(n^2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main idea behind distance vector routing algorithm?</p>
<ul>
<li>Based upon the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</li>
<li>Iterative (continues until no more updates)</li>
<li>Asynchronous (nodes do not have to be synchronized with each other)</li>
<li>Distributed (no need to know network topology or have some central point of
calculation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk through an example of the distance vector algorithm</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node maintains its own distance vector with costs to reach every other
node in the network. They send each other their distance vectors and update
accordingly if there are shorter paths found between what was already in its
distance vector and newly received information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When does count-to-infinity problem occur in the distance vector algorithm?</p>
<ul>
<li>When a large change occurs across a link, causing an infinite number of
updates to be propagated across nodes. This can continue to happen until the
nodes' tables eventually converge. This can happen if nodes have large positive
or negative numbers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does poison reverse solve the count-to-infinity problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>When one node knows there is a path through another node, it will poison the
opposite path so it is never taken. When bad news comes, it will take the
opposite path and pass on this information so the new path is quickly used and
the previous path becomes poisoned. This solves the problem with 2 nodes but is
not guaranteed to work for 3 or more nodes that are not directly connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the Routing Information Protocol (RIP)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the Distance Vector protocol and uses hop count as the metric
(each link = 1 cost). Uses RIP response message instead of distance vectors.
Each node maintains a RIP Table (Routing Table), which will have one row for
each subnet in the AS. Uses UDP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol?</p>
<ul>
<li>A routing protocol that uses the link-state routing algorithm to find the best
path between source and destination router. Advancement of RIP. Uses flooding of
link-state info and Dijkstra. Advances include authentication of messages,
option to use multiple same cost paths, and support for hierarchy within a
single routing domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a router process advertisements?</p>
<ul>
<li>The router checks if advertisement is new or duplicate by referring to the
link-state database. If its new, it updates this database and runs OSPF based on
current topology. It floods the LS update and updates FIB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is hot potato routing?</p>
<ul>
<li>When there are equally good egress points (network exits) - choose the one
that is the shortest (closest) path cost away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-4" id="lesson-4">Lesson 4</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 1 Study Guide for Lesson
4:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Describe the relationships between ISPs, IXPs, and CDNs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are the “backbone” network over which
smaller networks can connect. IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) are physical
interconnection infrastructures that are used by multiple networks (such as ISPs
and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)) to interconnect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDNs are networks created by content providers (such as Shopify/Netflix) to
reduce connectivity costs and provide greater control for the content provider
on how the content is delivered to the end-users. They may have multiple data
centers with hundreds of servers distributed across the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an AS?</p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous System (AS) - a group of routers that operate under the same
administrative authority. An ISP (or CDN) can operate as a single AS or
multiple. Each AS has its own set of policies/strategies based on their needs
and doesn’t need to share this info with other ASes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of relationship does AS have with other parties?</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition and cooperation. T1 ISPs compete with each other, T2 with each
other, etc - there is a hierarchy but this hierarchy is becoming more flat over
time thanks to evolutions such as IXPs and CDNs. Competing ISPs also need to
cooperate so that the Internet can work on a global scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is BGP?</p>
<ul>
<li>For traffic to go between ASes, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is used which is
primarily based on incentives (money) - ASes do whatever makes the most sense
for them from a financial standpoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does an AS determine what rules to import/export?</p>
<ul>
<li>It's entirely a business decision for both importing and exporting routes.
ASes are incentivized to advertise customer routes, peer routes none,
and provider routes none. For importing routes from other ASes, ASes are
incentivized to import customer routes most, peer routes less, and provider
routes none.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are were original the design goals of BGP? What was considered later?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The original design goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scalability - quick convergence and loop-free pathing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express routing policies - allow ASes to implement policies, filter and rank
routes, and keep these decisions confidential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing cooperation among ASes - allows ASes to make local decisions while
keeping these decisions confidential from other ASes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong> was not originally considered when implementing BGP, requiring
security measures to be added later as the Internet grew in size and complexity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the basics of BGP?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pair of routers, <strong>BGP peers</strong>, exchange routing info over a semi-permanent
TCP port connection <strong>(BGP session)</strong>. This starts with an OPEN message and is
followed by the routers sending each other announcements from their own routing
tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two types of <strong>BGP messages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong> - announcements of new routes/updates to existing routes;
withdrawal of previous routes due to a failure or change in routing policy</li>
<li><strong>KEEPALIVE</strong> - message exchanged to keep a current session going</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BGP routes</strong> - main components: reachable IP prefix field, AS-PATH (route
passed through from destination), and NEXT-HOP (IP of next-hop router along the
path towards the destination). In iBGP the NEXT-HOP is the address of the
nearest border router.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between iBGP and eBGP?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>eBGP</strong> - external BGP; BGP session between pair of routers in two different
ASes</li>
<li><strong>iBGP</strong> - internal BGP; BGP session between routers in the same AS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between iBGP and IGP-like protocols (RIP or OSPF)?</p>
<ul>
<li>iBGP is used to propagate information about what ASes can be reached by the
gateway routers in the current AS. IGP-like protocols are used to establish
paths between the internal routers of an AS based on specific costs within the
AS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a router use the BGP decision process to choose which routes to import?</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual policies are based on the business goals of the AS, but they all
follow the same process to select the best routes based on the policy in place.
The router compares a list of attributes, between a pair of routes, in top down
order - if two attributes are equal then it moves down to the next attribute and
so on.</li>
<li><strong>LocalPref</strong> is at the top and set by the local AS’ administrator based on
business relationships/preference of specific AS. <strong>Higher number = higher preference.</strong> Controls which routers are used as exit
points (outgoing traffic).</li>
<li><strong>MED</strong> (Multi-Exit Discriminator) is another important attribute and is set
by the neighboring ASes. <strong>Lower MED value = higher preference.</strong> A neighboring
AS with multiple links can tag routes with MED values to indicate which routers
are used as entry points (which links are preferred for inbound traffic).</li>
<li>LocalPref = outbound; MED = inbound</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are 2 main challenges with BGP? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability and misconfigurations or faults. An error can result in an
excessively large number of updates which can lead to route instability,
overloading, outages, etc.</li>
<li>ASes can reduce this risk by limiting routing table size with filtering to
encourage route aggregation and limiting the number of route changes with flap
damping (suppresses route updates for a period of time when a threshold is
reached which can be set individually for prefixes according to a specific
strategy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an IXP?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Exchange Points</strong> - physical infrastructures that provide the means
for ASes to interconnect and directly exchange traffic with one another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are four reasons for IXPs increased popularity?</p>
<ol>
<li>They can handle large traffic volumes comparable to T1 ISPs</li>
<li>Play an important role in mitigating DDoS attacks as they can play the role
of a “shield” such as with BGP blackholing</li>
<li>Provide a plethora of research opportunities into the evolution of the
Internet landscape</li>
<li>Active marketplaces with many services beyond interconnection - they have
been evolving from simple interconnection hubs to technology innovation hubs</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Keeps traffic local when both on the same IXP, lower costs, incentives from big
players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which services do IXPs provide?</p>
<ol>
<li>Public peering</li>
<li>Private peering (separate from public)</li>
<li>Route servers and service level agreements (many participants on a network
can use it with a single agreement/BGP session)</li>
<li>Remote peering through resellers (third parties can resell their connection
to IXP to networks that use less traffic/in distant area)</li>
<li>Mobile peering</li>
<li>DDoS blackholing (customer can trigger this to alleviate DDoS effects)</li>
<li>Free value-added services such as nameservers, local time, DNS root name
servers, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a route server work?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Route servers help to make peering more manageable. In summary, a Route Server
(RS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Collects and shares routing information from its peers or participants that
connects with (i.e. IXP members that connect to the RS).</li>
<li>Executes it’s own BGP decision process and also re-advertise the resulting
information (I.e. best route selection) to all RS’s peer routers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A typical routing daemon maintains a <strong>Routing Information Base (RIB)</strong> which
contains all BGP paths that it receives from its peers - the Master RIB.
The router server also maintains AS-specific RIBs to keep track of the
individual BGP sessions they maintain with each participant AS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSes maintain two types of route filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Import filters</strong> are applied to ensure that each member AS only advertises
routes that it should advertise</li>
<li><strong>Export filters</strong> which are typically triggered by the IXP members themselves
to restrict the set of other IXP member ASes that receive their routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-5" id="lesson-5">Lesson 5</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 1 Study Guide for Lesson
5:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the basic components of a router?</p>
<ul>
<li>Input/output ports, switching fabric, and the routing processor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the forwarding (or switching) function of a router</p>
<ul>
<li>The router’s action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to
the appropriate output link interface. Forwarding takes place at very short
timescales (typically a few nanoseconds), and is typically implemented in
hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switching fabric moves the packets from input to output ports. What are the functionalities performed by the input and output ports?</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the forwarding data plane (hardware) we have three main components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Input ports</strong> - first they physically terminate the incoming links to the
router, then they decapsulate packets, and finally (most importantly) they
perform the lookup function by consulting the forwarding table to forward the
packet to the appropriate output port through the switching fabric</li>
<li><strong>Switching fabric</strong> - moves packets from input to output ports</li>
<li><strong>Output ports</strong> - receive and queue packets from the switching fabric and
send them over to the outgoing link</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the purpose of the router’s control plane?</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the control plane (software), we have the routing processor which
implements the routing protocols, maintains the routing tables, and computes
the forwarding tables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What tasks occur in a router?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lookup</strong> - router looks at destination IP and consults forwarding table
(FIB) to determine output link using longest prefix matching algorithms</li>
<li><strong>Switching</strong> - aka forwarding this is the most important task of a router
where the router transfers the packet from the input link to the output link.</li>
<li><strong>Queuing</strong> - after the packet has been switched to a specific output port,
it needs to be queued if the link is congested</li>
<li><strong>Header validation and checksum</strong> - router checks the packet’s version
number, decreases time-to-live field, and recalculates the header checksum</li>
<li><strong>Route processing</strong> - routing processor uses routing protocols
(such as OSPF/RIP) to build the forwarding tables</li>
<li><strong>Protocol processing</strong> - routers need to use some protocols to implement
their functions including SNMP, TCP and UDP, and ICMP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>List and briefly describe each type of switching. Which, if any, can send multiple packets across the fabric in parallel?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Via memory</strong> - routing processor controls this method which involves the
packet being copied to the processor’s memory, consulting the forwarding table,
and copied the packet to the output’s port buffer. One packet at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Via bus</strong> - no routing processor involved - the input port puts an internal
header which designates the output port and sends the packet to the shared bus.
All output ports receive the packet but only the designated one keeps it. One
packet at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Via interconnection network</strong> - crossbar switch used so that multiple
packets can be carried at the same time as long as they are using different
input and output ports.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two fundamental problems involving routers, and what causes these problems?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bandwidth and Internet population scaling</strong> - caused by the increasing
number of devices that connect to the Internet, heavier traffic from new apps,
new technologies such as optical links that can handle higher volumes of
traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Services at high speeds</strong> - new apps may require new services such as
protection against delays in presence of congestion and protection during
attacks/failures. Offering these services at very high speeds is a challenge for
routers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the bottlenecks that routers face, and why do they occur?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many bottlenecks including exact lookups, prefix lookups, packet
classification, switching limitations, and security. Most are caused by scaling
issues - the need for high speed and service guarantees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is CIDR, and why was it introduced?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classless Internet Domain Routing</strong> - introduced to help with scaling as we
ran out of IP addresses so it allows IP addresses of arbitrary-length prefixes.
This helped decrease router table size but introduced the
longest-matching-prefix lookup problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name 4 takeaway observations around network traffic characteristics. Explain their consequences</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a large number of concurrent flows of short duration - therefore a
caching solution would not work efficiently.</li>
<li>Lookup speed is very important, a large part of the computational cost for
lookup is in accessing memory.</li>
<li>An unstable/inefficient routing protocol can lead to time increases</li>
<li>Memory usage trade-off - either use fast, expensive memory (cache in
software/SRAM) or cheaper but slower memory (DRAM)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do we need multibit tries?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unibit tries</strong> require too many memory accesses while <strong>multibit tries</strong>
solve this by using a stride. A stride is the number of bits that we check at
each step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is prefix expansion, and why is it needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding a given prefix to more prefixes so that we don’t miss out on any
prefixes. Gives more speed with a cost of increased database size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the benefits of variable-stride versus fixed-stride multibit tries?</p>
<ul>
<li>More optimized - takes up less space in prefix database, less memory access,
more flexible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-6" id="lesson-6">Lesson 6</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 1 Study Guide for Lesson
6:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why is packet classification needed?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet classification</strong> is needed to accomplish quality of service
guarantees and security guarantees that longest prefix matching based on
destination IP alone cannot do. This allows handling packets based on other
criteria such as TCP flags and source addresses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are three established variants of packet classification?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Firewalls</strong> - filter out unwanted traffic and enforce other security
policies</li>
<li><strong>Resource reservation protocols</strong> - used to reserve bandwidth between source
and destination</li>
<li><strong>Routing based on traffic type</strong> - used to avoid delays for time-sensitive
applications</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the simple solutions to the packet classification problem?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear search</strong> - reasonable for a few rules (such as in a firewall) but
otherwise inefficient.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong> - cache the results so that future searches can run faster.</li>
<li><strong>Passing labels</strong> - done in the header and typically at the edges which saves
time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does fast searching using set-pruning tries work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a trie on destination prefixes and then at every leaf-node we “hang” the
source tries that are compatible (or whatever other dimension we are considering
for packet classification). To match a prefix, we first traverse the destination
trie and then the source trie while keeping track of the lowest-cost matching
rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the main problem with the set pruning tries?</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory explosion - a source prefix can occur in multiple destination tries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between the pruning approach and backtracking approach for packet classification with a trie?</p>
<ul>
<li>Set pruning has a high cost in memory with a lower cost in time. Backtracking
saves memory but costs more in time. Each rule is only stored once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the benefit of grid of tries approach?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a middle-ground approach that balances the memory and time costs by
using precomputation with switch pointers. These are basically shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the “Take the Ticket” algorithm</p>
<ul>
<li>Each output line maintains a distributed queue for all input lines that want
to send packets to it. When an input line wants to send a packet to a specific
output line, it requests a ticket. The input line waits for the ticket to be
served. At that point, the input line connects to the output line, the
crosspoint is turned on, and the input line sends the packet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is head-of-line problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>The other lines are stuck in the line waiting for their turn - the entire
queue is blocked by the progress of the head of the queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to avoid head-of-line problem using knockout scheme?</p>
<ul>
<li>Break up the packets into a fixed size (cell). Have the fabric running N times
faster than the input links where k is the expected number of cells received by
an output link. For cases where the expectation is violated, randomly pick the
output that is chosen. Complex to implement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to avoid head-of-line problem using parallel iterative matching?</p>
<ul>
<li>All inputs send requests in parallel to all outputs they want to connect with.
This is the request phase. In the grant phase, the outputs randomly pick an
input out of its requestors. In the accept phase, inputs randomly pick an output
to send to. This way, all of the inputs are sending packets from the start.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe FIFO with tail drop</p>
<ul>
<li>Packets are sent to the output ports. The output ports are FIFO and any
packets that overflow the buffer (tail of the queue) are dropped. This results
in fast scheduling decisions but loss of packets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the reasons to make scheduling decisions more complex than FIFO?</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide quality of service (QoS) guarantees on measures such as delay and bandwidth. To provide additional (router) support for congestion. To promote
fair sharing of links among competing flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe Bit-by-bit round Robin scheduling</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives bandwidth and delay guarantees. We calculate the packet finishing time
for each packet and send the packet with the smallest finishing round number
based on the previous round of the algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bit-by-bit Round Robin provides fairness, what’s the problem with this method?</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires introducing extra time complexities such as keeping track of the
finishing time (requires priority queue). The extra complexities make it hard to
implement at gigabit speeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe Deficit Round Robin (DRR)</p>
<ul>
<li>Solves some of the time complexities of bit-by-bit round robin by using a
deficit counter instead of performing all the calculations of finishing time.
This ensures fairness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a token bucket shaping?</p>
<ul>
<li>Used for the scenarios where we want bandwidth guarantees for flows in the
same queue without separating them. Limits the burstiness of a flow by limiting
the average rate and limiting the maximum burst size. The technique assumes a
bucket per flow that fills with tokens at a rate R per second with a max of B
tokens. Additional tokens are dropped. When packets arrive, they can go through
if there are enough tokens, otherwise it must wait for more tokens to fill the
bucket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In traffic scheduling, what is the difference between policing and shaping?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Policing</strong> is a modified version of token bucket shaping - when a packet
arrives it needs to have tokens at the bucket already there. If the bucket is
empty, the packet is dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policing - sawtooth wave pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaper - keeps excess in a queue or buffer so traffic is delayed instead of
dropped. Smooth/shaped curve instead of sawtooth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is a leaky bucket used for traffic policing and shaping?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Similar to a bucket with a hole - constant flow of network traffic out of the
bucket where the bucket can be seen as the buffer, water represents packets, and
the leak rate is the rate at which packets are allowed to enter the network. If
the packet will not cause overflow to the bucket, the packet is added
(conforming) to the bucket. Otherwise it is discarded (non-conforming).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irrespective of the input rate of packets, the output rate is constant which
leads to uniform distribution of packets sent to the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="header" href="#lesson-7" id="lesson-7">Lesson 7</a></h1>
<p>The following are questions and answers from the Exam 2 Study Guide for Lesson
7:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What spurred the development of Software Defined Networking (SDN)?</p>
<ul>
<li>SDN arose as part of the process to make computer networks more programmable
. Due to a diversity of equipment and the requirement to handle different
proprietary technologies from different vendors for different network devices,
SDN works to redesign networks to make them more manageable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the three phases in the history of SDN?</p>
<ol>
<li>Active networks</li>
<li>Control and data plane separation</li>
<li>OpenFlow API and network operating systems</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize each phase in the history of SDN.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Packaging of code in network packets to create flows / QoS for different
packet types. Most of this occurred at the edge of the network. Code was
executed inside of Virtual Machines. Backbone network managers were not
comfortable with arbitrary code execution by any developer on network nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packet forwarding was implemented directly in the hardware. This era
tailored to administrators being able to control / manage routing decisions.
Emphasized programmability in the control domain rather than the data domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vision of fully programmable networks for research is realized, and
then actually used by businesses / ISPs. Abstracted away the specifics of
vendor software / proprietary products and allowed the entire network to be
treated as one programmable entity. Lead to the rise of network operating
systems and distributed state management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the function of the control and data planes?</p>
<ul>
<li>The control plane contains the logic that implements the forwarding behavior
of routers such as routing protocols and network middlebox configurations.</li>
<li>The data plane performs the actual forwarding as dictated by the control
plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why separate the control from the data plane?</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent evolution and development - prior to their separation, any
changes to the control plane had to be met with upgrades to the hardware.</li>
<li>Control from high-level software programs - software computes the forwarding
tables in SDN, allowing us to use high-order or more abstract programming
languages to implement routing algorithms. This also makes debugging and
checking the behavior of the network easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the SDN lead to opportunities in various areas such as data centers,
routing, enterprise networks, and research network?</p>
<ol>
<li>Data centers - SDN assists in the management of large data centers with
thousands of servers and VMs.</li>
<li>Routing - SDN has the capability to make routing decisions using multiple
criteria, and can easily update a router's state for the implementation of
BGP policies. This provides mre control over path selection.</li>
<li>Enterprise networks - SDN improves security applications for enterprise
networks. An example being dropping attack traffic at strategic locations
within the network to mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack.</li>
<li>Research networks - SDN enables research networks to coexist with
production networks (they so easy to create and tear down).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the relationship between forwarding and routing?</p>
<ul>
<li>In forwarding, the router inspects the packet coming in from a port,
consults the routing table, and sends the packet to the output port dictated
by the forwarding table. Forwarding is a function of the data plane.</li>
<li>In routing, routers use routing algorithms to generate the forwarding table,
implementing policies and using these algorithms to determine the best path
for traffic. Routing is a function of the control plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between a traditional and SDN approach in terms of
coupling of control and data plane?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the traditional approach, the control and data planes are closely
coupled. The router runs routing algorithms and generates the forwarding table
. In the SDN approach, the remote controller computers and distributes
forwarding tables. The controller is physically separated from the router.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the main components of SDN network and their responsibilities?</p>
<ul>
<li>SND-controlled network elements - infrastructure layer, responsible for
forwarding traffic using rules computed by the SDN control plane.</li>
<li>SDN controller - logically centralized entity that behaves as an interface
between the network elements and the network-control applications.</li>
<li>Network-control applications - programs that manage the underlying network
by collecting information about the network elements with the help of the SDN
controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the four defining features in an SDN architecture?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow-base forwarding - rules for packets can be computed based on any
number of header field values in various layers (transport, network, link).</li>
<li>Separation of data and control planes</li>
<li>Network control functions - controller maintains up-to-date network state
information and provides it to the network-control applications. This enables
network-control applications to monitor and control network devices.</li>
<li>Programmable network - enables the implementation of sophisticated routing
applications to include network management, traffic engineering, security,
automation, analytics, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the three layers of SDN controller?</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication layer - comms between the controller and the network elements</li>
<li>Network-wide state-management layer - stores information about the network
state</li>
<li>Interface to the network-control application layer - communication between
controller and network-control applications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
