# Lesson 10

* What is DNS censorship?
* What are the properties of GFW (Great Firewall of China)?
* How does DNS injection work?
* What are the three steps involved in DNS injection?
* List five DNS censorship techniques and briefly describe their working
principles.
* Which DNS censorship technique is susceptible to overblocking?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of “packet dropping” DNS censorship
technique?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of “DNS poisoning” DNS censorship
technique?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of “content inspection” DNS censorship
technique?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of “blocking with resets” DNS censorship
technique?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of “immediate reset of connections” DNS
censorship technique?
* Our understanding of censorship around the world is relatively limited. Why is
it the case? What are the challenges?
* What are the limitations of main censorship detection systems?
* What kind of disruptions does Augur focus on identifying?
* How does Iris counter the issue of lack of diversity while studying DNS
manipulation? What are the steps associated with the proposed process?
* What are the steps involved in the global measurement process using DNS
resolvers?
* What metrics does Iris use to identify DNS manipulation once data annotation
is complete? Describe the metrics. Under what condition, do we declare the
response as being manipulated?
* How to identify DNS manipulation via machine learning with Iris?
* How is it possible to achieve connectivity disruption using routing disruption
approach?
* How is it possible to achieve connectivity disruption using packet filtering
approach?
* Explain a scenario of connectivity disruption detection in case when no
filtering occurs.
* Explain a scenario of connectivity disruption detection in case of the inbound
blocking.
* Explain a scenario of connectivity disruption detection in case of the
outbound blocking.
